# DSA-210-Term-Project
Sabanci University 2025 Spring term DSA 210 Lecture term project

## **Project Idea**

This project investigates the evolving preferences of anime fans within the rapidly expanding global anime market. Once a niche interest, anime has achieved mainstream popularity, driven by its distinctive art styles and compelling narratives. The anime market, valued at USD 31.41 billion in 2023 and projected to reach USD 72.86 billion by 2032 (CAGR 9.8%), necessitates a deeper understanding of consumer trends. This research will analyze data from platforms like MyAnimeList and AniList, alongside with relevant economic and demographic data from sources like the IMF and World Bank, to identify key drivers of anime fan preferences. Specifically, this study will explore how factors such as genre. popularity, location, age, and gdp per capita correlate with user ratings and engagement.

## **Motivation**

There are currently over 10000 animes currently on the internet. Just the current Winter 2025 season had 165 anime. With over 10,000 anime available and new seasons introducing hundreds more, navigating the vast anime landscape is challenging for both new and long-time fans. To build an effective anime recommendation AI, we must first understand the key elements driving viewer preferences. This project will first find these key elements and secondly will create an anime recommendation AI using these key elements.

## **Sources of Data**

Main source will be the datasets I found in kaggle about anime. If possible data scrapping will be used to find more recent data.
Addition data like GDP per capita and etc. will be found from reliable international sources like IMF and World Bank

## **Description of the Dataset**

The dataset for this project consists of data from online resources. Here is what I will try to find and implement:

- **Gender**: The gender of the user

- **User Watching**: The amount of anime the user is currently watching
- **User Completed**: The amount of anime the user completed
- **User Dropped**: The amount of anime the user dropped
- **User Plan to Watch**: The amount of anime the user is planning to watch
- **User Days Spent Watching**: The amount of days the user spent watching anime
- **User Location**: The location(country) of the user  
- **User Mean Score**: Mean score of the scores given by the user
- **GDP Per Capita**: GDP per capita of the country the user is in
- **Life Expectancy of the User's Location**: Life expectancy of the user's location

## **Conclusion**

By the end of this project, I hope to answer the following questions:

- Which factors most influence an anime's popularity?  
- Can wwe guess how succesfull an anime is going to be before airing?  
- Are myths like romance is more popular among females and action is more popular among males realy true??  
- Can we apply these insights to create an anime recommendation AI?
